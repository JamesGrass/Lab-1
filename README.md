# Lab-1


The code that we wrote is clear and understanable becasue it uses a very simple system and aslong as someone knows how to read code then it should be more then clear what it does.
Yes they can becase we set "a" and "b" before the code so if they need it to be a diffrent number they can change it and it would still accomplmish the same task. Not only that but the LED color change and the diffrent pins could be changed to suit your prefrence if the board is slighly diffrent.
